          <p>
            Entrepreneur, along with Energage, present our third-annual Top Company Culture List, showcasing high-performance cultures across the U.S. We measured these companies focusing on 24 factors across seven areas: alignment, effectiveness, connection, management, engagement, leadership and basics, including pay, benefits and training.  
          </p>
          <p>  
            Based on the results, we chose 150 companies to be featured in our ranking. We divided the companies based on size: small (35-74 employees), medium (75-299 employees) and large (300 or more employees).
          </p>
          <p>
            Congrats to all.
